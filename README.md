QuadWarp
==========================================
This Glyph script computes the warpage in degrees of quad cells. Warp is
defined as the angle between normal vectors of the two triangles
obtained by diagonalizing the quad. The script returns the maximum
warpage obtained by both diagonalizations of the quad. The script lets
the user choose the structured domains on which warp is to be computed.
